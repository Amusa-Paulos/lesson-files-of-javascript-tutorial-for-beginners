            <p  style="padding: 10px; font-weight:bold;">
                HISTORY: Javascript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995 and became
                the most popular language for web development. It is used by
                every major website and application. It is a very powerful
                language and is used by many large companies such as Google,
                Facebook, and Yahoo!
                <br>
                It became ECMA standard in 1999 and is now called the ECMAScript
                standard. ECMA-262 is the official standard for the language.

                What is JavaScript? JavaScript is primarily a client-side language. 
                JavaScript started at Netscape, a web browser developed in the 1990s. 
                A webpage can contain embedded JavaScript, which executes when a user visits 
                the page. The language was created to allow web developers to embed executable 
                code on their webpages, so that they could make their webpages interactive, or 
                perform simple tasks. 
                Today, browser scripting remains the main use-case of JavaScript.

                JavaScript’s syntax is inspired by C++ and Java. If you have 
                experience in C++ or Java, JavaScript’s syntax will seem familiar to you.

                JavaScript is named after Java, and many ideas are borrowed from the Java language. 
                Other than that, Java and JavaScript are two entirely distinct languages
            </p>
